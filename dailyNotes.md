#### General info
GAP was combined with landfire for a seemless veg layer, most imagery is from 1999-2001
- landfire has a historical dataset
- gap is more a recent classification scheme.

*NASA spatial extent limit*

there is a non compete clause where NASA can not go lower then 30m spatial res.

fort morgan area might have lidar data for the courses. THere is a 1m dem for that region, I just dont know how far off the river it extends

**exersice 1**
the gap analysis tool allows you to select land cover are various group levels. 4 degrees of specificity

climate data and projections
 - how to deal with a netcdf file? can check in with helen over the course of the week

 - identify the key climate drivers of the system, that is what should be focused on.
 - gridded data is most impacted by topographic conditions because that is where climate changes the most
 - interpolations are generally based on the average elevation data.
 - GCM are often biased corrected and downscaled
 - patterns at broad spatial scale and match to finer scales and know locations
 - prism data is not really appropriate for trend analysis because of variability in inputs over time
 - the Maurer data set would be more appropriate
 - use GCM to inform parameters of a sensitivity analysis;
 - not recommend to ensemble the climate data first; that is don't take the mean of multiple models and use that. It's better to run a sensitivity analysis across
 - to conduct the sensitivity analysis it can be as simple as adding a +1 +2 +3 degrees across all the data
  *this is similar to the delta method, where the known distribution is shift proportionally*
 - **statistical downscaling is not meant to improve the signal of change**
 - even if it does change it is hard to know if those changes are accurately a plus.
 - **dynamic downscaling using local observed data can be helpful**

 - Water Balance; Potential Evapotransparation (PET) is a climate variable
  - (PET) is built on: temperature, wind, rain, precipitation
  - actual evapotranspration has to be less then potential.
  - Really against the kitchen sink approach, you need to define what is important


## 3/6/2016

### risk framework
[Exposure] + [Sensitivity] = [Potential Impact] - [Adaptive Capability] = Vulnerability

### scenario planning
**Brian Miller**

scenerio planning is the attempt to account for uncertainty
